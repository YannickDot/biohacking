You should always implement the lifestyle techniques first, supplements are like the icing on the cake that give you the extra 10% improvement :)

#### Sleep ðŸ›ŒðŸ’¤

*Sleep is the ultimate biohack, period.
Whoever says "I'll sleep when I'm dead" nowadays is basically a moron!*

It's like sex : QUALITY > Quantity
